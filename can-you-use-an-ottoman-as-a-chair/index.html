I personally flip up the top and use it as a coffee table but you can sit on it. But the ottoman is more than just a foot rest. An ottoman by definition is typically a short and padded piece of furniture that is often used as a footstool though they do have other uses. If youre using your ottoman as a footrest it should be 12 inches apart from the couch.</p>
