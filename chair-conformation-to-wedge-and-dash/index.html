To be graded properly include the hydrogen atoms on the halogen-bearing carbon atoms. These structures make it easy to show the conï¬guration at each stereogenic center in the molecule without using wedges and dashes. Identify the up tip OR down tip of your chair conformation and draw a straight line up up tip or down down tip parallel to the y-plane. Fischer projections also allow an easy classiï¬cation of the sugar. The chair reference is just referring to the repeating zig-zag shape across the longitudinal axis of the molecule.</p>

<p>Solved Which Wedge And Dash Drawing Correctly Represents The Chegg Com These structures make it easy to show the conï¬guration at each stereogenic center in the molecule without using wedges and dashes. So while a wedge is always drawn as up in the chair conformation in the book you can just turn the page upside down and it is now down but obviously still the same molecule. So if you drew a wedge in position 1 and a dash in position 2 it would mean that they are on the same plane - either both axial or both equatorial - assuming that the ring was in a chair conformation. Lets get some practice drawing it chair confirmations one way to do it is to start by drawing two parallel lines that are offset from each others let me go ahead and show you what I mean so heres heres one line and then here is another line theyre parallel to each other but theyre offset a little bit next were going to draw two horizontal dotted lines so the top horizontal dotted line is.

So while a wedge is always drawn as up in the chair conformation in the book you can just turn the page upside down and it is now down but obviously still the same molecule. Its important to realize that a chair flip does not turn a wedge into a dash but instead turns an axial into an equatorial. Ive seen chair conformation defined in that way before. Remember that the skeleton image shown above is more conveniently drawn but loses the 3 rd dimension information so you have to put it back in the chair to determine which should be bolded and which should be wedge.</p>

So if you drew a wedge in position 1 and a dash in position 2 it would mean that they are on the same plane - either both axial or both equatorial - assuming that the ring was in a chair conformation. For the following the disubstituted cyclohexane rings. Lets work through an example consider drawing a Newman projection by looking at the following wedge-dash.</p>

Level three is recognizing cis and trans on a cyclohexane ring and understanding that up substituents can be equatorial as well as axial. Cl 11 Br ll Br. Chair conformation is 3D as drawn on paper. All cyclohexanes have two chair conformations. Remember that the skeleton image shown above is more conveniently drawn but loses the 3 rd dimension information so you have to put it back in the chair to determine which should be bolded and which should be wedge.</p>

Level three is recognizing cis and trans on a cyclohexane ring and understanding that up substituents can be equatorial as well as axial. Alkanes Introduction To 3d Structures Alkanes Are Drawing Chair Conformations A. Lets get some practice drawing it chair confirmations one way to do it is to start by drawing two parallel lines that are offset from each others let me go ahead and show you what I mean so heres heres one line and then here is another line theyre parallel to each other but theyre offset a little bit next were going to draw two horizontal dotted lines so the top horizontal dotted line is. So while a wedge is always drawn as up in the chair conformation in the book you can just turn the page upside down and it is now down but obviously still the same molecule.</p>

<p>Ms 900 Conformers And Cyclohexane Practice Mendelset These structures make it easy to show the conï¬guration at each stereogenic center in the molecule without using wedges and dashes. Which wedge-and-dash drawing correctly represents the chair conformation given. Dashed lines to represent bonds that extend away from the. Remember that the skeleton image shown above is more conveniently drawn but loses the 3 rd dimension information so you have to put it back in the chair to determine which should be bolded and which should be wedge. Wedge and dash is 2D representation of a 3D object so you cant just turn things upside down obviously. Number the carbon atoms in the cyclohexane structure that you draw.</p>
